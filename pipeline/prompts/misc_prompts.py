1. **Question Types**: All questions should be short-answer questions that are answerable based on the visual information in the chemical. All questions can be answered with a single word, phrase, or number. (as short as possible)
    (1) **Descriptive questions** ask for the basic information in the chemical, such as the number of atoms, bonds, the name of the chemical, basic properties, etc.
    (2) **Reasoning questions** require reasoning over multiple information in the chemical. These questions should be more challenging and require a deeper understanding of the chemical. Usually, you need to iterate through the flow of the chemical and combine multiple pieces of information to answer these questions.
    (3) **Chemical Type-specific questions** are questions that are specific and unique to this chemical type {figure_type}. These questions should be tailored to the content and structure of the chemical.

2. **Provide Explanations**: 
    (1) In addition to a *concise answer* (as short as possible) for each question, provide a *step-by-step explanation* that details the reasoning steps to reach the answer.
    (2) For complex reasoning questions, the explanation should be more detailed and include all the necessary steps.

3. **Response Format**: Use | to separate the question, explanation, and concise answer for each example.
    (1) Follow this format: question | explanation | concise answer, e.g., which part of this chemical causes it to have bitter taste? | This chemical has the structure of alkaloid (see the nitrogen atom), which causes the bitter taste. | alkaloid.
    (2) Separate the question-answer pairs by double newlines (\n\n). question1 | explanation1 | answer1\n\nquestion2 | explanation2 | answer2\n\n...
    (3) Do not provide too many questions, 5-7 questions are enough. Focus on the diversity and quality of the questions with a very detailed explanation for challenging questions.
    (4) The concise answer should be as short as possible and directly answer the question. The answer should be faithful and exactly the same as what you would expect to see in the chemical, don't rephrase it.
