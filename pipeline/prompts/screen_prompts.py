GENERATE_SCREEN_QA_PROMPT = """You are an expert in screenshot analysis and good at asking questions about screenshots.
My persona is: "{persona}"
I want you to generate some question-answer pairs of a {figure_type} about {topic}, which I would ask.
Instead of showing the screenshot, I provide the materials and the code that generates the screenshot.

Here is the data:
{data}

Here is the code that generates the screenshot:
```
{code}
```

Please come up with a list of *reasonable questions* that people will ask when they see the rendered screenshot. Here are the requirements:
1. **Question Style**: The questions must be natural and related to the screenshot, which can help interpret the data and understand the insights.
    (1) The questions vary in complexity. Some are easy to answer by just referring to the screenshot, and some are challenging and require multiple-step reasoning.
    (2) The questions should be answerable based on the *visual information* in the screenshot. Don't include any coding details in the questions since this type of information is not visible in the screenshot.

2. **Question Types**: Most questions are short-answer, but some can be multiple-choice, yes/no, or summary questions. You can use the following types:
    (1) Short-answer: At least 5 short-answer questions.
    (2) Multiple-choice: There should be at least two multiple-choice questions. The number of options can be 3, 4, 5, or more. The option labels can be different types: alphabet, Arabic numerals, or Roman numerals. The correct option should be different in each question.
    (3) Yes/No (True/False): At least 1 binary question.
    (4) Summary: At least 1 summary question that asks for describing the *entire screenshot* or the *main idea* of the screenshot.
    (5) Unanswerable: At least 1 question cannot be answered based on the visual information in the screenshot. The answer to this question can be "Cannot be determined", "Not enough information", "I don't know", etc.

3. **Provide Explanations**: In addition to a *concise answer* for each question, provide an explanation that details the reasoning steps to reach the answer. For the summary question, the explanation is a more detailed description of the screenshot.

4. **Response Format**: separate the question, answer, and explanation with a | character: question | answer | explanation. The question-answer pairs should be separated by double newlines (\n\n).
For example:
what is the total revenue? | $100,000 | The total revenue is the sum of all revenue sources in the screenshot.

which product has the highest sales? A. Product A B. Product B C. Product C | B | Product A - $10,000, Product B - $15,000, Product C - $5,000. Product B has the highest sales.

    (4) Make sure the width of the HTML is almost the same as the width of the screenshot, do not leave too much blank space on the left or right side of the screenshot (e.g., content="width=
    
2. **Code Requirements**: 
    (1) You need to hardcode the provided data into the HTML script to generate the screenshot. Be careful with the syntax and formatting of the HTML script.
