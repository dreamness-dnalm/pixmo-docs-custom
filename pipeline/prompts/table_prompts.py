Here is the data:
{data}

Here is the code that generates the table:
```
{code}
```

Please come up with a list of *reasonable questions* that people will ask when they see the rendered table. Here are the requirements:
1. **Question Style**: The questions must be natural and related to the table, which can help interpret the data and understand the insights.
    (1) The questions vary in complexity. Some are easy to answer by just referring to the table, and some are challenging and require multiple-step reasoning.
    (2) The questions should be answerable based on the *visual information* in the table. Don't include any coding details in the questions since this type of information is not visible in the rendered table.

2. **Question Types**: Most questions are short-answer, but some can be multiple-choice, yes/no, or summary questions. You can use the following types:
    (1) Short-answer: At least 5 short-answer questions.
    (2) Multiple-choice: There should be at least two multiple-choice questions. The number of options can be 3, 4, 5, or more. The option labels can be different types: alphabet, Arabic numerals, or Roman numerals. The correct option should be different in each question.
    (3) Yes/No (True/False): At least 1 binary question.
    (4) Summary: At least 1 summary question that asks for describing the *entire table* or writing a caption for the table.
    (5) Unanswerable: At least 1 question cannot be answered based on the visual information in the table. The answer to this question can be "Cannot be determined", "Not enough information", "I don't know", etc.

3. **Provide Explanations**: In addition to a *concise answer* for each question, provide an explanation that details the reasoning steps to reach the answer. For the summary question, the explanation is a more detailed description of the table.

4. **Response Format**: separate the question, answer, and explanation with a | character: question | answer | explanation. The question-answer pairs should be separated by double newlines (\n\n).
For example:
what's the difference between the max value of column A and column B? | 15 | Max of A is 10 and that of B is 25, so the difference is 25-10=15

Which group has the highest value? A. Group-1 B. Group-2 C. Group-3 | B | Group-1 is 20, Group-2 is 25, and Group-3 is 15, so Group-2 has the highest value.

2. **Question Types**: All questions should be short-answer questions that are answerable based on the visual information in the table.
    (1) **Retrieval questions** ask for specific values or facts in the table (keep the exact same format in the table). Some easy questions can be answered directly from the table. Some more challenging questions may require combining and filtering information from multiple rows or columns.
    (2) **Compositional questions** contain multiple mathematical/logical operations like sum, difference, and average, median, etc.
    (3) **Fact-based questions** ask for whether a specific fact is yes or no (true of false) based on the data. Make sure to have balanced numbers of yes/no questions.
    (4) **Complex reasoning questions** require multiple steps reasoning over multiple data points in the table. These questions should be more challenging and require a deeper understanding of the data.

3. **Provide Explanations**: 
    (1) In addition to a *concise answer* (as short as possible) for each question, provide a *step-by-step explanation* that details the reasoning steps to reach the answer.

4. **Response Format**: Use | to separate the question, explanation, and concise answer for each example. 
    (1) Follow this format: question | explanation | concise answer, e.g., what's the average value of group A? | There are 5 data points in group A, sum them up is (34 + 45 + 23 + 56 + 12) = 170, so the average is 170/5 = 34 | 34

    (3) Do not provide too many questions, 5-10 questions are enough. Focus on the diversity and quality of the questions with a very detailed explanation for challenging questions.
    (4) The concise answer should be as short as possible and directly answer the question. All words in the response should be processed in natural language, no coding terms and remove any unnecessary characters.
