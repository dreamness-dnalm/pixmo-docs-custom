```
{code}
```

Please come up with a list of *reasonable questions* that people will ask when they see the rendered document. Here are the requirements:
1. **Question Style**: The questions must be natural and related to the document, which can help interpret the data and understand the insights.
    (1) The questions vary in complexity. Some are easy to answer by just referring to the document, and some are challenging and require multiple-step reasoning.
    (2) The questions should be answerable based on the *visual information* in the document. Don't include any coding details in the questions since this type of information is not visible in the document.

2. **Question Types**: Most questions are short-answer, but some can be multiple-choice, yes/no, or summary questions. You can use the following types:
    (1) Short-answer: At least 5 short-answer questions.
    (2) Multiple-choice: There should be at least two multiple-choice questions. The number of options can be 3, 4, 5, or more. The option labels can be different types: alphabet, Arabic numerals, or Roman numerals. The correct option should be different in each question.
    (3) Yes/No (True/False): At least 1 binary question.
    (4) Summary: At least 1 summary question that asks for describing the *entire document* or the *main idea* of the document.
    (5) Unanswerable: At least 1 question cannot be answered based on the visual information in the document. The answer to this question can be "Cannot be determined", "Not enough information", "I don't know", etc.

3. **Provide Explanations**: In addition to a *concise answer* for each question, provide an explanation that details the reasoning steps to reach the answer. For the summary question, the explanation is a more detailed description of the document.

4. **Response Format**: separate the question, answer, and explanation with a | character: question | answer | explanation. The question-answer pairs should be separated by double newlines (\n\n).
For example:
what is the total revenue? | $100,000 | The total revenue is the sum of all revenue sources in the document.

which product has the highest sales? A. Product A B. Product B C. Product C | B | Product A - $10,000, Product B - $15,000, Product C - $5,000. Product B has the highest sales.

    (2) **Reasoning questions** require reasoning over multiple information in the document. These questions should be more challenging and require a deeper understanding of the document.
    (3) **Document Type-specific questions** are questions that are specific and unique to this document type {figure_type}. These questions should be tailored to the content and structure of the document.

2. **Response Format**: Use | to separate the question, explanation, and concise answer for each example. 
    (1) Follow this format: question | explanation | concise answer, e.g., what is the total revenue? | The total revenue is the sum of all revenue sources in the document, which is $2000 + $3000 + $5000 = $10000. | $10000

    (4) The concise answer should be as short as possible and directly answer the question. The answer should be faithful and exactly the same as what you would expect to see in the document, don't rephrase it.

GENERATE_DOCUMENT_POINT_PROMPT = """You are an expert web designer and are good at editing HTML to add points for localization usage.
Task description: You are given a {figure_type} about {topic} and need to generate pointing data for it.
You need to first create a point intent, as well as the name for those points, and then modify the HTML code to add the points that can be visualized in the rendered page.

Here is the orginal HTML code:
<code>
{code}
</code>

Here are the requirements:
1. **Point Intent**: 
    (1) The point intent is like a question or goal that people will ask about what to point out in this {figure_type}, e.g., "Point to the vegeterian dishes in the menu.", "Show me the total revenue in the table.", etc.
    (2) I want you to generate one intent for each of the following types:
        (i) **Simple Single Point**: A simple intent that requires pointing to a single element which can be recognized quickly.
        (ii) **Complex Single Point**: A complex intent that requires multi-hop reasoning or calculation.
        (iii) **Multiple Points**: An intent that requires pointing to multiple elements.
        (iv) **Specific Single Point**: An intent lead to a point that is unique to this type of document.
        (v) **{intent_type}**
    Please try your best to adhere to those types and create diverse intents that cover different aspects of the document. You can adjust the intent based on the content of the document.
    (3) Use the prefix of "{prefix}" to start the point intent. You can also create your own style if you think it's more suitable and natural.
    (4) Most intents will just point to **one element**, so you just need to change one line of code.

2. **Point Names**: Assign a name for all the points that satisfy the intent. The name should be short and descriptive, e.g., "Vegeterian Dishes", "Total Revenue", etc.

3. **Editing HTML**: I have figured out how to modify the HTML to add points, you just need to follow the instructions below:
    (1) I have added the styles (`point-container` and `location-point`) for the points in the original HTML code. You just need to use the provided CSS classes to add the points.
    (2) To add the points, you need to first identify the elements in the HTML that satisfy the intent. Then, apply the CSS classes to these elements to add points over them.
    (3) Usage: element --> <span class="point-container">element<span class="location-point"></span></span>, remember the element here can be any HTML element, no need to be a entire span, can be a single word.
    (4) The point should be precise and accurate, pointing to the exact element that satisfies the intent and should not be too coarse grained.
    (5) You don't need to provide the full HTML code, just the modified lines with the points added (You can have multiple points in one line). **Do not change any other parts of the HTML code**, 

The output format is:
<intent_1>
The goal or question about what to point out.
</intent_1>

<name_1>
A short name for the points.
</name_1>

<modified_lines_1>
The modified lines of the HTML code with the points added. Using the following format:
original line x --> modified line x
original line y --> modified line y
